                <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla Coil", is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.</p>

                <h3>Famed Inventor</h3>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working for the famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their different personalities. While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially ou-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of the history's most important inventions.</p>

                <h3>Best Known Invention</h3>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his next endeavor. He applied for many patents for his AC power discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio and television transmission.</p>
